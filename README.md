This is the fucking human being manifesto

0Act. Read the fucking manifesto only if you aim to become a fucking human being.

1Act. Be a fucking human being and do not hurt other fucking human beings. If you hurt other fucking human beings, you are a fucking animal and not a fucking human being.

2 Act. Be a fucking human being and stand up on your two feet. That will render a fucking human being shadow, reminding you who the fuck you are.

3Act. Be kind with others, because you want others to be kind with you. Do so by being a fucking human being please.

4 Act. Be a fucking human being and do not ask things you are not capable of doing by yourself. If you do so, you are fucking bothering other fucking human beings and wasting the fucking humanity time which is no precious.

5Act. Be a fucking human being. Use that Instagram, Facebook, etc, time to help others to become fucking human beings.

6Act. Be a fucking human being and phone another fucking human being. Enjoy the fucking conversation, and ask that person to call another fucking human being. Repeat several times a day. Fuck, that shit works a lot.

7Act. Be a fucking human being. Are you capable of writing emails or reading a Disney story? Then please -PLEASE- fucking help others. You are in a select group of fucking human beings that’s capable of doing more than the rest of the fucking humanity. Simply ask if anyone needs some fucking help.

8 Act. Open a fucking book, stop using Google. Smell the paper, get connected to the tree that is now a collection of fantastic ideas and knowledge in your home library. Honor the fucking tree. That will deliver lasting memories or get some of your brain cells reactivated.

9Please fucking act. Be a fucking human being. If you are planning to behave like an asshole, refer to the first rules. Don’t be a fucking asshole. Forgiving, gives fucking pleasure. Revenge is for assholes, fuck those Hollywood stories.

10 Act. Stop reading stories about your breakfast, how to stay up with large teams and their motivation, or how to improve your relationship during these days. Refer to your fucking education, common sense, what your parents told you. Learn to read your fucking gut feelings. Find answers there, become a fucking human being by yourself.
